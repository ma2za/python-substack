# Python Substack

# Introduction

This is an unofficial library providing a Python interface for [Substack](https://substack.com/).
I am in no way affiliated with Substack. It works with
Python versions from 3.7+.

# Installation

You can install python-substack using:

    $ pip install python-substack

# Usage

Set the following environment variables by creating a **.env** file:

    PUBLICATION_URL=https://ma2za.substack.com
    EMAIL=
    PASSWORD=
    USER_ID=

To discover the USER_ID go to your public profile page,
in the URL bar of the browser you find the substack address 
followed by your USER_ID and your username:
https://substack.com/profile/[USER_ID]-[username]


The .env file will be ignored by git but always be careful.
